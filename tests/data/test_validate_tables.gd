## Placeholder test scaffold for the table validator.
##
## Integrate with the existing Godot test runner (`tests/` harness) once the
## data workflow is wired into CI. The intent is to execute the Python script
## via `OS.execute` against fixture TSVs and assert zero exit code for the
## happy path plus non-zero for cyclic dependency fixtures.

func run() -> void:
	# Future implementation: spawn validate_tables.py on sample fixtures.
	pass
