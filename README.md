# Project Yolkless Scaffold

Idle game prototype built with Godot 4.x. This scaffold provides:

- Balance-driven systems with hot-reloadable TSV configuration
- Node-based economy/research/save singletons wired through the main scene
- Tooling scripts for running the project, running headless simulations, and building Linux exports

## Requirements

- Godot 4.2+ CLI available as `godot4`

## Project Structure

We are standardising on a split between Godot scene assets under `game/` and feature code/data in top-level folders:

- `src/` â€” runtime scripts and services (e.g., `src/modules/conveyor`, `src/services/AutomationService.gd`)
- `ui/` â€” reusable UI scenes/widgets (e.g., `ui/widgets/EnvPanel.tscn`)
- `data/` â€” authored TSV/JSON curves and configuration outside the Godot import pipeline
- `game/` â€” existing scenes, autoload singletons, and legacy scripts (migrated over time)

When adding new systems, prefer the `src/`, `ui/`, and `data/` layout and migrate legacy `game/scripts` as part of module-focused work.

## Usage

- `./tools/run_dev.sh` launches the playable prototype. Press `R` in-game to hot-reload `game/data/balance.tsv` after tweaking numbers.
- Core loop preview: hold the Burst button or press `Space`, buy upgrades, promote the farm, prestige to earn research points, and purchase research nodes.
- Naming, icons, and copy follow `docs/theme_map.md` (Egg Credits, Reputation Stars, Innovation Lab, etc.).
- Strings and balance data hot-reload together; editing `strings_egg.tsv` + tapping `R` updates live UI text.
- Set `Config.seed` in the inspector to a non-zero value to enable deterministic RNG for repeatable PPS/burst timing runs.
- Early game now starts at 0/50 credits; prod_1 (10 ðŸ¥š) and cap_1 (12 ðŸ¥š) unlock within seconds, and manual feeding clearly boosts PPS for the opening minute.
- CI smoke tests: run `./tools/ci_smoke.sh` (uses `godot4 --headless -s res://game/scripts/ci_smoke.gd`) for a sub-second load check; if the import cache is cold it performs a one-time `--import` warmup first. When a deeper pass is required, use `./tools/check_only.sh`, which wraps `godot4 --headless --verbose --check-only project.godot` and streams output to `logs/godot-check.log`; give it up to 600â€¯s on fresh workspaces.

## Ship cycle (WSL quick flow)

```bash
# 1) work on a roadmap item
git switch -c feature/RM-021-environment

# 2) stage & commit (include RM/PX footers)
git add -A && git commit -m "feat(environment): scaffold service layer\n\nRM: RM-021\nPX: PX-021.1"

# 3) publish & open PR (use gh if installed; otherwise push and open the link)
git push -u origin HEAD
# gh pr create --fill --title "RM-021 Environment Layer (PX-021.1)" --body-file docs/roadmap/RM-021.md

# Save the driver text as a PX file
code docs/prompts/PX-021.1.md   # paste canvas text
```

## Art Placeholders

- All current visuals are procedural or simple SVG stand-ins documented in `docs/ART_POLICY.md`. Asset keys map through `assets/AssetMap.json`; drop a final file into `assets/final/`, update the JSON, and Godot will load it without code changes.

## Logging & Strings

- Logging is enabled by default and writes to `user://logs/yolkless.log`, rotating at ~1â€¯MB with three historical segments (`yolkless.log.1`â€¦).
- The autoload `YolkLogger` buffers entries and flushes every 0.5â€¯s; set `Config.logging_enabled=false` or `logging_force_disable=true` to stop emission safely.
- Press `F3` to open the diagnostics overlay for live PPS, research multipliers, log status/size, and the latest tail lines.
- Edit `game/data/strings_egg.tsv` to tweak player-facing copy. Press `R` in-game to hot-reload both balance numbers and these strings.
- Each session begins with a single header containing the Godot build, timestamp, and active seed; tail exports redact URLs, emails, and tokens automatically.

## UI Enhancements

- Capacity bar tracks Egg Credits versus storage and hot-reloads with balance tweaks (`R`).
- Feed button now shows a live Feed Supply meter that drains while held and refills when idle.
- A lightweight VisualDirector autoload drives feed particle visuals that ramp with Feed Supply and PPS; disable them via the Settings â†’ Visual Effects toggle.
- Visual Layer is a background `CanvasLayer`; the HUD sits on a higher layer so buttons stay interactive while visuals play underneath.
- The `VisualViewport` control stretches with the window, keeping particle modules centered and auto-resized across any viewport.
- All player-facing strings are driven via `game/data/strings_egg.tsv`; pressing `R` refreshes both numbers and copy.
- Press `F3` to toggle the debug overlay with live PPS, capacity, burst state, tier, research multipliers, hashes, and log context.

## Hold-to-Feed Meter

- Holding the Feed button (or `feed_hold` action) drains a dedicated Feed Supply bar; releasing stops feeding instantly.
- The bar refills automatically when idle, and three feed upgradesâ€”storage, refill, efficiencyâ€”expand capacity, speed, and output.
- Meter colours shift from green â†’ amber â†’ red as reserves drop, with an optional High Contrast mode in Settings.

## Environment Simulation

- RM-021 plans a new `EnvironmentService` driving temperature, light, humidity, and air quality curves that gently influence power, feed, and prestige systems.
- UI and presentation updates (weather icon, environment panel, ambience shifts) will live under the new `ui/` and `src/` directories as work lands.
- Legacy `EnvironmentDirector` notes remain archived in `docs/prompts/RM-010.md`; refer to `docs/roadmap/RM-021.md` for active requirements.

## Accessibility & Diagnostics

- Open the in-game **Settings** panel to choose 100â€¯% / 110â€¯% / 125â€¯% text scale, enable High Contrast UI, and copy Diagnostics to the clipboard.
- The new Visual Effects checkbox toggles the Feed Particles module (default ON) for lower-spec or distraction-free play.
- A Reset Save button (with confirmation) clears `user://save.json` and reloads the session instantly.
- Diagnostics export includes build/seed metadata, tier state, upgrade/research snapshots, constants, and the last 200 log lines (sanitised).
- The High Contrast toggle applies WCAG AA compliant themes to the storage bar and feed meter for both dark and light backgrounds.
- Offline resumes surface a single popup per session summarising Egg Credits earned while away.

## Offline Behavior

- Farms simulate at a passive rate while the game is closed, using base PPS scaled by `OFFLINE_EFFICIENCY` and `OFFLINE_PASSIVE_MULT`.
- Feed boosts only apply when you are actively online; unlocking automation grants the `OFFLINE_AUTOMATION_BONUS` multiplier during those passive ticks.
- Offline earnings still respect the cap window (`OFFLINE_CAP_HOURS`) and clamp to the current storage capacity.

## Conveyor Module

- `src/modules/conveyor/` houses the Conveyor Manager, Belt, and Item scripts. Belts chain configurable segments with per-run speed and capacity caps, pushing items forward with easing when queues clear.
- `ConveyorManager` exposes `item_spawned`, `item_delivered`, and `throughput_updated` signals while logging smoothed items/sec plus queue depth via `YolkLogger`.
- `scenes/demo_conveyor.tscn` includes a timer-driven spawner and HUD label so designers can watch flow, jams, and delivery cadence without wiring the full farm.
- Full usage notes live in `docs/modules/conveyor.md`; clone the segment template there to embed belts in future factory stages.

## Scripts

- `tools/run_dev.sh` â€” launch the game (set `NO_WINDOW=1` to use headless mode)
- `tools/ci_smoke.sh` â€” warm imports if needed, then run the fast CI smoke script
- `tools/check_only.sh` â€” verbose `godot4 --check-only` wrapper that tees logs to `logs/godot-check.log`
- `tools/headless_tick.sh <seconds>` â€” runs the headless economy probe (`godot4 --headless` + `res://game/scripts/ci/econ_probe.gd`) and streams dumps/summary data to `logs/yolkless.log`
- `tools/build_linux.sh` â€” export a Linux build (requires configured export preset)

Make scripts executable: `chmod +x tools/*.sh`.

## Balance Data

- `game/data/balance.tsv` â€” master table defining constants, upgrades, factory tiers, automation rules, research nodes, and prestige math. Press `R` during a session to reload.
