# Release Milestones

> Companion to [Release Playbook](Release_Playbook.md). Defines phase gates, required evidence, and owning teams. Owners update this table whenever an RM/PX shifts status.

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Core RMs | Evidence & Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Prototype** | RM-009 conveyor module demoable; RM-010 HUD prototype in main scene; RM-011 economy loop playable 10 min | First telemetry smoke (`scripts/telemetry_replay_demo.py`) uploaded in CI; comfort baseline captured; DocOps bootstrap green | RM-009, RM-010, RM-011, RM-000 | - PR artifacts: `kpi.json`, `kpi_chart.png`<br>- Screens: HUD + conveyor overlay<br>- DocOps lint report attached |
| **Alpha** | Prototype exit satisfied; automation/power services enabled with safeguards; nightly telemetry job stable | Comfort index ±5 % over week; UI accessibility checklist signed; automation UI surfaced | + RM-012, RM-013, RM-014, RM-018 | - Nightly dashboard diff vs prior week<br>- Accessibility checklist (`docs/qa/RM-010-ui-checklist.md`)<br>- StatBus catalog entries for new metrics |
| **Beta** | Alpha exit satisfied; environmental simulation + prestige loop thematically complete; release plan drafted | Performance budgets met (p95 tick targets); localization pipeline dry-run complete; telemetry dashboards gated on blockers | + RM-015, RM-017, RM-021, RM-020 | - Performance budget report vs `docs/quality/Performance_Budgets.md`<br>- Localization checklist sign-off<br>- Release milestone review notes |
| **Launch** | Beta exit satisfied; event/risk systems wired; factory layout experience stable | Final build exported to target platforms; release changelog tagged; monitoring plan active | + RM-016, RM-019, outstanding polish RMs | - Tag-triggered changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`) reviewed<br>- Release retrospective template pre-filled<br>- LiveOps runbook circulated |

## Validation Checklist

### Prototype Phase
- [ ] Conveyor demo scene reviewed by design + engineering.
- [ ] Telemetry smoke artifacts reviewed in PR (see below).
- [ ] DocOps lint + `make validate-contracts` run locally.

### Alpha Phase
- [ ] Nightly telemetry dashboards show no regression >5 %.
- [ ] Automation and power docs (`docs/modules/automation.md`, `docs/modules/power.md`) updated with latest guardrails.
- [ ] UI accessibility checklist signed by UX.
- [ ] Metrics diffs posted in PR summary when KPIs shift >3 %.

### Beta Phase
- [ ] Performance budget report attached (tick + render + CI fallback).
- [ ] Localization run recorded; string table queued for translators.
- [ ] Release timeline reviewed with Production; risks logged in `docs/qa/Risk_Register.md`.

### Launch Phase
- [ ] Final builds archived; hash recorded in Release Playbook.
- [ ] Release changelog merged (auto-generated on tag).
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard links distributed to LiveOps.
- [ ] Post-launch retrospective scheduled.

## Artifact Review Guidance
- CI uploads telemetry artifacts for every PR (`artifacts/telemetry/kpi.json` & `kpi_chart.png`). Review comfort index, PPS, and alerts against baseline before approving modules tied to RM-011/RM-014.
- Dashboards generated by `tools/gen_dashboard.py` must be referenced in milestone reviews. Compare `sandbox_tick_ms_p95`, `power_ratio_avg`, and `ci_delta_abs_max`.
- For milestone exits, attach links in the PR/ADR referencing this doc and enter checks above into the description.

## Ownership
- **Production:** Maintains this doc, ensures phase gates align with roadmap updates.
- **QA Automation:** Supplies telemetry reports and dashboard diffs.
- **Module Owners:** Update “Core RMs” column when scope shifts.
