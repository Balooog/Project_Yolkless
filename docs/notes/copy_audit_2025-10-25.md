# Copy Audit — 2025-10-25

- Verified primary HUD strings against `docs/theme_map.md`.
- Updated `burst_button` label in `game/data/strings_egg.tsv` to “Feed the Hens! (hold)” to match the theme map guidance and reduce all-caps shouting.
- Confirmed other top-level labels (`Egg Credits`, `Innovation Lab`, `Rebrand & Advance to Next Generation`) already align with the canonical naming.
- No additional copy drift detected in `strings_egg.tsv`; revisit once new sheets land in RM-010 follow-ups.
