# PX-020.2 — Automation Panel Interaction & Wiring

> Extends the PX-013 automation HUD with explicit panel open/close feedback, target selection, and StatBus mirroring so automation intent is visible across UI, telemetry, and docs.

## Summary
- Define how the Automation Panel advertises its lifecycle through `automation_panel_opened`, `automation_panel_closed`, and `automation_target_changed(target_id)` signals.
- Ensure panel interactions update StatBus (`automation_target`) and HUD slots without delaying the calm pacing expected in PX-010 sheet designs.
- Provide UX notes for controller / keyboard focus, copy tone, and tooltip hooks so PX-020.3 can build on a stable frame.

## Goals
1. Capture panel state transitions so automation metrics can be replayed and audited without screen recordings.
2. Document focus + accessibility behaviors (e.g., which control regains focus when the panel closes) referencing [UI Baseline Layout Spec](../ui_baselines/README_UI_BASELINE_LAYOUT.md).
3. Clarify how automation choices change the economy/conveyor stats already surfaced in PX-020.1.

## Dependencies
- [PX-020.1 GUI Wiring](PX-020.1_GUI_Wiring.md) for stat definitions and HUD slots.
- [PX-013.2 Automation HUD and Scheduling Preview](../prompts/PX-013.2.md) for existing panel layout + data binding.
- [Signals & Events](../architecture/Signals_Events.md) and [StatBus Catalog](../architecture/StatBus_Catalog.md) to log the new automation events and stat keys.
- [Modules — Economy](../modules/economy.md) and [Modules — Conveyor](../modules/conveyor.md) for downstream effects on PPS/backlog.

## Tasks & Deliverables
| Task | Description | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Signal contracts | Document payloads and listeners for panel open/close + target change | `docs/architecture/Signals_Events.md` entries |
| StatBus mirror | Describe how `automation_target` is written (replace stack, string enum) | `docs/architecture/StatBus_Catalog.md` + telemetry notes |
| UX flow | Narrative explaining focus handling, copy tone, and animation pacing | This doc + links to `docs/design/UX_Principles.md` |
| Panel + HUD coherence | Show how slot D/F react when automation mode throttles PPS (copy guidelines, tooltip summary) | Cross-links to PX-020.3 + modules |
| Validation notes | Spell out smoke steps (open panel, change targets, verify StatBus + replay output) | Acceptance section |

## Acceptance Criteria
- All panel signals are documented with emitters, payloads, listeners, and frequency expectations.  Example listeners include AutomationService, UIPrototype, and telemetry probes.
- StatBus catalog lists `automation_target` with owner, stack rule, unit, and governance note referencing this PX.
- Interaction narrative details controller + mouse focus order, copy tone, and tooltip sources, with links back to UI and UX docs.
- Validation steps describe how to confirm the panel events reach StatBus (e.g., via replay logs or StatBus inspector) without requiring new code.
