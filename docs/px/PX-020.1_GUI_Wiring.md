# PX-020.1 — GUI Wiring (Economy Rate + Conveyor Backlog)

> Adds HUD Slot D (economy rate) and Slot F (conveyor backlog) plus the supporting signals so production clarity becomes instant even during headless validation.

## Summary
- Surface `economy_rate` and `conveyor_backlog` as right-aligned HUD labels fed by typed signals from Economy/Conveyor.
- Keep layout changes bounded to the HUD dock defined in the [UI Matrix](../ui_baselines/ui_matrix.md) and [UI Baseline Layout Spec](../ui_baselines/README_UI_BASELINE_LAYOUT.md).
- Mirror the same values inside the prototype Top Banner so parity exists between production and design explorations.

## Goals
1. Document how `economy_rate_changed(rate, label)` and `conveyor_backlog_changed(queue, label, tone)` flow from Economy to StatBus, HUD, and telemetry consumers.
2. Describe the HUD baselines (PNG + `ui_assert_baseline`) that protect Slot D and F so future visual tweaks remain safe.
3. Provide replay + DocOps hooks so PX-020.4 can extend telemetry without re-discovering design intent.

## Dependencies
- [Economy Module](../modules/economy.md) for PPS computation, smoothing, and thresholds.
- [Conveyor Module](../modules/conveyor.md) for backlog semantics and jam heuristics.
- [Signals & Events](../architecture/Signals_Events.md) and [StatBus Catalog](../architecture/StatBus_Catalog.md) entries created in this phase.
- Roadmap alignment via [PX-020 Series Roadmap](../roadmap/PX_20_Series_Roadmap.md) and scheduling per [Shipping Implementation Plan](../roadmap/Shipping_Implementation_Plan.md).

## Tasks & Deliverables
| Task | Description | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HUD slot definition | Slot D/F coordinates, anchor rules, neutral tokens | `docs/ui_baselines/ui_matrix.md` update + link back here |
| Signal documentation | Add `economy_rate_changed` + `conveyor_backlog_changed` payloads and listener notes | `docs/architecture/Signals_Events.md` |
| StatBus registration | Declare `economy_rate`, `_label`, `conveyor_backlog`, `_label` (replace stack) | `docs/architecture/StatBus_Catalog.md` |
| Module briefs | Summarize smoothing, backlog thresholds, and HUD copy tone | `docs/modules/economy.md`, `docs/modules/conveyor.md` |
| Replay visibility | Note label printouts + CSV columns for sanity review | `docs/px/PX-020.4_Telemetry_Replay.md` cross-reference |

## Acceptance Criteria
- Slots D/F documented with rects, anchors, and linked to PX-020 docs plus the UI baseline README.  `ui_assert_baseline` callouts describe safe-area expectations.
- Signals and StatBus entries are published with listener + owner info, matching the terminology used in Replay and StatBus modules.
- Module briefs explicitly call out economy rate smoothing and conveyor backlog stall triggers.
- Replay tooling (`tools/replay_headless.gd`) is referenced with the new label logging behavior so QA knows how to read headless output.
