# PX-010.10 — Store & Research Panels Usability Pass
**Targets:** RM-010 — UI & Control Architecture  
**Branch:** `feature/RM-010-store-research-usability`  
**Status:** Planned

## 1. Scope
Unify Store and Research panels using shared atoms, improve readability, and guarantee the early-game upgrade loop is clear and reachable within five minutes.

## 2. Objectives
1. Create reusable list cell component (`/ui/components/StoreListItem.tscn`) with tokenised typography, price badges, and state (affordable, locked, purchased).
2. Bind price and requirement data via helper functions; show disabled-with-reason tooltip for unavailable upgrades.
3. Introduce scroll container tweaks: inertia, keyboard focus preservation, and safe-area padding.
4. Validate the Balance Playbook expectation: first purchase achievable under five minutes due to clear affordances.

## 3. Deliverables
- Component scenes/scripts: `StoreListItem`, `ResearchListItem` (or parameterised variant).
- Updated Store/Research sheet scenes leveraging components.
- Hotkey and controller focus integration for list navigation.
- Documentation: usability checklist appended to `docs/ux/UI_Principles.md` plus note in `docs/design/Balance_Playbook.md`.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
1. Store and Research panels share consistent layout, iconography, and tooltip behaviour.
2. Disabled items explain requirements (e.g., “Needs Tier 2 Research”) via tooltip and inline label.
3. Scrolling keeps focus visible; no items off-screen when navigating via controller or keyboard.
4. Playtest log (manual) demonstrates first purchase within five minutes following instructions.

## 5. Tests & Validation
- Manual flow: start new profile, navigate panels with controller and mouse, confirm clear messaging.
- UILint verifies overflow-free labels and size flags.
- Optional automated test: simulate econ flux to ensure UI updates without jitter.

## 6. Dependencies
- Requires atoms and layout from earlier PX tasks.
- Relies on tooltip system (PX-010.11) for final messaging but can stub temporarily.

## 7. Rollback Plan
- Revert to previous Store/Research layout and remove new components; economy loop unaffected.
