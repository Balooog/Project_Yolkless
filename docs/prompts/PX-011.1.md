# Project Yolkless – PX-011.1
### Early Economy Loop Tuning (Targets RM-011)

---

## 1) Scope
Tune the **opening 3–5 minutes** so players experience clear progress (earn, cap, dump, repeat) **without being able to buy any upgrades**.  Only core production, manual feeding, and storage interact.  Balance via `data/balance.tsv` with hot-reload (`R`) per scaffold.

---

## 2) Objectives
1. **Pace**: Reach first storage cap in **60–120 s** with normal play (some manual feeding bursts).
2. **Loop**: At cap, a visible dump/sell tick triggers, resetting storage and continuing flow.
3. **No Upgrades**: All upgrade prices sit beyond reachable credits for 5 min of optimal play.
4. **Readability**: HUD shows PPS, storage %, and “Cap Reached” pulse; diagnostic overlay confirms rates.
5. **Determinism**: With a fixed seed, simulated runs reproduce earnings ±2 %. (Use `Config.seed`.)

---

## 3) Economy Dial Targets
- **Base Passive PPS**: 0.40 credits/s (hands-off).
- **Manual Feed Burst**: x6 multiplier while holding, with feed drain limiting sustained burst to ~4 s then 6 s recovery.
- **Starting Storage**: 50 credits.
- **Dump Cadence**: Auto-sell every time storage hits 100 %; clear to 0 and continue.
- **Upgrade Price Floor**: First visible upgrades (`prod_1`, `cap_1`) priced so **unaffordable** until ≥6 minutes even with optimal bursts.

---

## 4) Balance Table Edits (proposed)
> Edit `data/balance.tsv` and reload in-session with **R**.

## 5) Logic & UI Nits (no new systems)

1. **Auto-Dump**: When `storage >= STORAGE_START`, enqueue a single “Sell” event that:

   * Adds `storage` → `credits`, sets `storage=0`, plays 300 ms pulse.
2. **Manual Feed** (existing input): While `feed_hold`:

   * `pps = BASE_PPS * MANUAL_FEED_MULT` **if** `feed_supply > 0`, drain; else fall back to `BASE_PPS`.
   * Off-hold: refill until `FEED_SUPPLY_MAX`.
3. **Diagnostics**: Ensure F3 overlay includes **PPS (current)**, **Storage (value/max)**, **Burst state**, **Seed** (already scaffolded).

---

## 6) Implementation Tasks

1. **Balance**: Apply `tsv` edits above.
2. **EconomyTick**: In the economy/autoload (existing singleton), add a guard for `DUMP_ON_FULL`.
3. **HUD Pulse**: Add a small tween/pulse on the storage bar when a dump occurs (no new art).
4. **Gate Prices**: Ensure the shop UI reads `VISIBLE` and `PRICE` from TSV; keep buttons disabled but tooltips active.
5. **Seeded Check**: Expose `Config.seed` field in the main scene (already supported) and set test seed to `12345` for QA.

---

## 7) Acceptance Criteria

1. **Cap timing**: With no input, first dump occurs in **2–3 minutes** (0.40 PPS → ~120–180 s to 50).
   With reasonable bursts, first dump occurs in **60–120 s**.
2. **Upgrade lock**: After **5 minutes** of optimal (“hold whenever full”) play, player has **< 250** credits; shop buttons remain disabled.
3. **Loop clarity**: Storage bar fills, hits 100 %, pulses, and resets to 0 with credits increasing accordingly.
4. **Performance**: No frame drops or GC spikes during continuous hold/release.
5. **Determinism**: Two runs with `seed=12345` produce total credits within **±2 %** at t=300 s.

---

## 8) Deliverables

* **TSV**: `data/balance.tsv` (migrate from `game/data/balance.tsv`, keep constants + early prices updated)
* **Code**:

  * `src/economy/Economy.gd` – add auto-dump logic (guarded by `DUMP_ON_FULL`)
  * `ui/hud/HudStorageBar.gd` – add pulse tween on dump
* **Docs**:

  * `docs/prompts/PX-011.1.md` (this file)
  * `docs/notes/economy_early_loop.md` (1-pager with measured timings)
* **QA Tooling**:

  * `tools/headless_tick.sh <seconds>` — run headless sim hooks (already scaffolded; keep usage)
  * `src/ci/econ_probe.gd` — logs PPS, storage fill/dump timestamps to `logs/yolkless.log`

---

## 9) Test Plan (manual + headless)

1. **Hot-reload loop**: Run `./tools/run_dev.sh`, press **R**, verify values apply live.
2. **Hands-off timing**: No input from t=0; record first dump time. Expect 120–180 s.
3. **Burst timing**: Hold feed until supply empties; repeat cycles. Expect first dump ≤120 s.
4. **Five-minute credit check**: After 300 s of optimal bursting, total credits `< 250`.
5. **Seeded headless**: Launch headless with `Config.seed=12345`; run 300 s; verify totals within ±2 % across two runs.

---

## 10) Notes / Risks

* If players still reach 250 too quickly, raise **PRICE(prod_1)** to **300–350** and/or reduce **MANUAL_FEED_MULT → 5.0**.
* If progress feels sluggish, lift **BASE_PPS → 0.45** **or** drop **STORAGE_START → 45** (keep first-cap under 2 min).
* Keep future work (automation, research) hidden until RM-012+ to avoid accidental unlocks.
