# PX-016.1 — Upgrade & Research System
**Targets:** RM-012  
**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Outcome:** Planned

## Driver Prompt
# Project Yolkless – PX-016.1  
### Upgrade & Research System (Targets RM-012)

---

## 1. Scope
Create a unified framework for credits-based upgrades and research point unlocks. Data lives in TSV files with prerequisite chains, and UI presents both linear shop lists and a research graph.

## 2. Functional Objectives
1. **Schema Unification**
   - Define TSV columns for id, category, cost, multipliers, prerequisites.
   - Support both soft-currency and research currencies.
2. **Unlock Progression**
   - Research nodes unlock upgrades and automation tiers.
   - Passive RP tick and milestone-based RP injections.
3. **UI Implementation**
   - Shop tab for linear purchase flow with tooltips.
   - Research Lab tab visualizing unlock graph with statuses.
4. **Signals & Telemetry**
   - Emit events on purchase/unlock for ShopDebug and telemetry.
5. **Persistence**
   - Save/load upgrade ownership, research progress, and RP totals.

## 3. Architecture Notes
- Extend `Balance.gd` parsing to load new TSV schema.
- Introduce `Research.gd` service with RP accrual and unlock validation.
- Rework `ShopService.gd` to consume unified data and expose reason codes.
- UI builds on `Main.tscn` panels; leverage theme tokens from RM-010.
- Connect to automation gating (RM-013) and prestige resets (RM-015).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
1. TSV updates hot-reload without restarting the game.
2. Shop UI displays availability, costs, and blocking reasons accurately.
3. Research Lab graph updates when nodes unlock or become purchasable.
4. Passive RP tick and milestone rewards align with balance targets (RM-011).
5. Save/load reproduces state exactly after restart.

## 5. Deliverables
- Updated TSV files in `data/` (migrate from `game/data/`).
- Revised `ShopService.gd`, `Research.gd`, and UI scenes.
- Developer docs explaining schema and data entry workflow.
- Automated tests covering unlock validation and save round-trips.
- Telemetry hooks for upgrade purchase timing.

## 6. Future Extensions
- Multi-stage research projects requiring time/inputs.
- Prestige-only research tree expansions.
- Community mod support for custom upgrade packs.
