# RM / PX Prompt Archive

Major roadmap prompts live in this folder so that design intent and key driver attempts remain traceable.

## Naming Rules
- `RM-###.md` — Canonical roadmap goal/spec. Exactly one per roadmap ticket.
- `PX-###.x.md` — Driver prompt that materially advances the roadmap item. Use incremental suffixes (`.1`, `.2`, …) for each major attempt.

Minor follow-up or troubleshooting prompts are intentionally not archived; only capture the drivers that ship scope or reshape direction.

Use the templates (`_TEMPLATE_RM.md`, `_TEMPLATE_PX.md`) when adding new entries. Paste the full Codex canvas text into PX files and keep deliverables/validation concise.
