**Outcome:** Planned

## Driver Prompt
# Project Yolkless – PX-018.2  
### Release Phases & Milestones (Targets RM-017)

---

## 1. Scope
Define the release roadmap from prototype through public launch, aligning roadmap modules with milestone gates and codifying build/tag automation.

## 2. Functional Objectives
1. **Phase Definition**
   - Phase 0: Manual Loop Prototype (Economy + HUD)
   - Phase 1: Automation + Power Core
   - Phase 2: Upgrade & Research Integration
   - Phase 3: Prestige & Long-Term Systems
   - Phase 4: Art/Audio Polish + QA
2. **Milestone Criteria**
   - Entry/exit requirements per phase tied to RM completion.
3. **Version Tagging**
   - Branch/tag guidelines for CI and release packaging.
4. **QA & Telemetry**
   - Checkpoints for regression suites and telemetry baselines.
5. **Communication**
   - Templates for changelogs and release notes.

## 3. Architecture Notes
- Maintain milestone tracker in `/docs/roadmap/RM/RM-017.md`.
- Automate tagging via CI scripts (e.g., Git hooks or GitHub Actions).
- Coordinate with QA to define regression suites per phase.
- Reference telemetry outputs (RM-014) to validate goals.
- Provide schedule projections and slack buffers.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
1. Published milestone document with dependencies mapped to phases.
2. Build/tag process documented and tested.
3. QA checklist per milestone stored in repo.
4. Communication plan (release notes template, announcement cadence) complete.
5. Roadmap index reflects phase progress (percent complete).

## 5. Deliverables
- `/docs/roadmap/RM/RM-017.md` expanded with phase charts.
- CI/automation scripts supporting tagging.
- QA milestone checklists in `/docs/qa/`.
- Release note templates in `/docs/releases/`.
- Project timeline overview (Gantt or tabular).

## 6. Future Extensions
- Automated burndown dashboards.
- Localization readiness checkpoints.
- Public roadmap site integration.
