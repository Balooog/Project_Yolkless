# PX-010.2 — Controller & Accessibility UX Expansion
**Targets:** RM-010 — UI & Control Architecture  
**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Outcome:** Planned  

## Scope
Complete gamepad navigation and accessibility features for the prototype HUD, ensuring parity between keyboard, mouse, and controller inputs with inclusive color schemes.

## Objectives
1. Implement full controller focus map for bottom tabs, sheets, and canvas actions (D-pad/LS navigation, RT feed).  
2. Add controller shortcuts: `Y` opens Store, `X` opens Research, `RT` triggers feed, `LB/RB` cycle tabs, `B` closes sheets.  
3. Provide color-blind safe palettes (deuteranopia/protanopia), available via Accessibility settings.  
4. Expose Accessibility settings panel in `SettingsPanel` (contrast toggle, palette selection).  
5. Update UI prototype to display controller hints where appropriate.  

## Deliverables
- `/ui/input/ControllerMap.gd` — manages focus and shortcuts.  
- `/ui/settings/AccessibilityPanel.tscn` + script.  
- Updated HUD scenes with controller focus metadata and hints.  
- Documentation updates: `UI_Principles.md`, `Style_Guide.md`.  

## Validation
- Full gameplay loop can be completed using controller only (feed, purchase, promote, prestige).  
- Accessibility panel toggles palettes and persists setting via Config/Save.  
- Color contrast passes WCAG AA for all HUD text/icons in each palette.  
- Controller shortcuts documented and shown in UI hints.
