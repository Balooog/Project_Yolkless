# PX-020.1 - Art and Audio Pipeline Foundations
**Targets:** RM-020  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Establish the asset import, palette management, and layered audio pipeline needed for era progression and prestige theming.

## Objectives
1. Define asset tiers and file placement under `assets/` with palette tokens wired to `ui/theme/Tokens.tres`.
2. Implement audio layering that responds to power ratio, automation cadence, and events.
3. Provide tooling to batch update palettes and audio mixes.
4. Document submission guidelines for future art and audio contributions.

## Dependencies
- Environment tiers (PX-021.6).
- Power warnings (PX-018.3) for audio triggers.
- Accessibility pass (PX-010.13) for contrast and caption requirements.

## Deliverables
- Asset manifest updates and palette scripts.
- Audio manager script with layering support.
- Tooling notes in `docs/dev/Tooling.md`.
- Pipeline documentation in `docs/roadmap/RM/RM-020.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Era props and palettes load via the new pipeline without manual scene edits.
2. Audio layers blend smoothly across automation, event, and prestige states.
3. Tooling scripts validate palettes and audio mixes in CI.
4. Documentation covers asset naming, import settings, and review steps.
