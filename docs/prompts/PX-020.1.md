# PX-020.1 — Art / Audio Pipeline
**Targets:** RM-020  
**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Outcome:** Planned

## Driver Prompt
# Project Yolkless – PX-020.1  
### Art / Audio Pipeline (Targets RM-020)

---

## 1. Scope
Define the production pipeline for adaptive art and audio, including layered ambience, day/night cycles, upgrade-tier assets, and prestige-driven palette shifts.

## 2. Functional Objectives
1. **Audio Layers**
   - Background ambience scaling with factory activity.
   - Event-driven cues tied to RM-016 events.
2. **Visual Progression**
   - Asset tiers per upgrade level (RM-012).
   - Palette shifts and lighting adjustments per prestige tier (RM-015).
3. **Day/Night Cycle**
   - Power usage influences lighting and ambient color.
4. **Pipeline Tooling**
   - Asset import/export guidelines, naming conventions, and batching.
5. **Documentation**
   - Style guide articulating calm mastery tone.

## 3. Architecture Notes
- Implement `AudioDirector.gd` managing layered tracks and crossfades.
- Coordinate with `PowerService.gd` for lighting cues.
- Use Godot theme overrides and shaders for palette shifts.
- Build asset checklist templates for art/audio teams.
- Incorporate telemetry hooks to measure audio/visual triggers (RM-014).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
1. Audio layers respond smoothly to throughput changes without pops.
2. Visual palette shifts activate on prestige reset and revert reliably.
3. Day/night cycle reflects power ratio and time progression.
4. Asset pipeline documentation approved by art/audio stakeholders.
5. Demo scene showcases combined art/audio transitions.

## 5. Deliverables
- `/src/services/AudioDirector.gd` and associated resources.
- Shader/theme assets enabling color shifts.
- Style guide in `/docs/art/`.
- Sample asset packs demonstrating tiered visuals.
- QA checklist for audiovisual regression.

## 6. Future Extensions
- Dynamic music tracks with adaptive stems.
- Seasonal or community art swaps.
- User-adjustable ambience sliders with presets.
