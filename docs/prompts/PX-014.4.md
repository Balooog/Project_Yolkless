# PX-014.4 - StatsProbe Diff Dashboards
**Targets:** RM-014  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Outcome (2025-11-02)
- `tools/gen_dashboard.py --diff <baseline> <candidate>` now ingests the full numeric set from telemetry summaries (stats/final/summary) and prints delta tables plus new alerts.
- Added doc guidance in `docs/quality/Telemetry_Replay.md` so QA can run the diff locally.
- dry run: `python3 tools/gen_dashboard.py --diff /tmp/baseline.json /tmp/candidate.json` (see branch logs) and `python3 tools/docs_lint/check_structure.py`.

## Scope
Automate comparison of telemetry outputs between baseline and PR runs, surfacing comfort, PPS, and timing deltas in a diff-friendly dashboard.

## Objectives
1. Extend `tools/gen_dashboard.py` to accept two telemetry runs and produce a diff report.
2. Emit flag files or exit codes when deltas exceed defined thresholds.
3. Store diff artifacts in CI for reviewers and include links in PR templates.
4. Document how to run the diff locally and interpret output.

## Dependencies
- PX-013.2 to ensure automation metrics exist in the telemetry set.
- Telemetry exports stable from PX-017.1 deliverables.

## Deliverables
- Updated dashboard generation script with diff mode.
- CI wiring (Makefile or GH workflow) that runs diff on demand.
- Docs update in `docs/quality/Telemetry_Replay.md`.
- Sample diff committed under `artifacts/telemetry/`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Running diff mode highlights metric changes greater than configured thresholds.
2. CI exposes diff artifacts for every PR that modifies simulation code.
3. Documentation explains configuration flags and thresholds.
4. Reviewers can open the diff locally without additional tooling.
