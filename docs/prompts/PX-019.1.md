# PX-019.1 - Factory Layout Adjacency Integration
**Targets:** RM-019  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Deliver the initial layout grid with adjacency bonuses that feed Economy, Power, and Automation systems.

## Objectives
1. Implement a typed grid data model with placement rules and cost checks.
2. Compute adjacency modifiers and route them through StatBus to the Economy.
3. Persist layout state and adjacency bonuses in the save file.
4. Provide editing UX with ghost previews and soft warnings for invalid placements.

## Dependencies
- Environment tier data (PX-021.6) to inform adjacency modifiers.
- Power warnings (PX-018.3) to reflect consumption changes.
- Automation UI (PX-013.2) to show layout-driven scheduling.

## Deliverables
- Grid manager scripts under `src/layout/`.
- HUD placement sheet and inspector hooks.
- Save migration covering layout payload.
- Documentation in `docs/roadmap/RM/RM-019.md` and `docs/modules/power.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Players can place, move, and remove buildings within the grid using both mouse and controller.
2. Adjacency bonus calculations produce deterministic StatBus entries and appear in Economy multipliers.
3. Save/load restores layout state without drift.
4. Telemetry captures placement events and adjacency totals.
