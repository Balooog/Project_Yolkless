# PX-022.1 - Localization Dry Run
**Targets:** RM-017, Ops  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Perform a pseudo-localization pass, validate pipeline tooling, and document the workflow for future translators.

## Objectives
1. Run pseudo-localization across all string tables and surface layout regressions.
2. Validate export/import tooling for string bundles.
3. Capture overflow issues and file tracking in the risk register.
4. Document the localization process in `docs/ops/Release_Playbook.md`.

## Dependencies
- Accessibility updates (PX-010.13).
- Prestige theming copy (PX-015.1).
- Localization scripts referenced in `docs/dev/Tooling.md`.

## Deliverables
- Pseudo-localized build artifacts.
- Issue log for overflow or clipping problems.
- Updated documentation for localization workflow.
- Optional automation script entries in CI.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Pseudo-localized build runs through UI smoke tests without crashes.
2. Overflow issues identified and tracked with owners.
3. Localization docs include step-by-step instructions and validation checklist.
4. Pipeline tooling validated in CI or a recorded manual run.
