# PX-018.3 - Power Warning Feedback
**Targets:** RM-018  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Document and ship calm power warning feedback across UI, audio, and telemetry so deficits are visible without disrupting the comfort loop.

## Objectives
1. Define warning tiers and thresholds in PowerService with typed configuration.
2. Drive HUD tint and icon changes when power ratio drops below targets.
3. Trigger paired audio cues that respect accessibility toggles.
4. Log power warning episodes to telemetry with duration and severity (StatBus + StatsProbe columns).

## Dependencies
- PX-013.2 automation UI to reflect throttling.
- Art/audio token updates from PX-020.1.

## Deliverables
- PowerService updates with warning thresholds and timers.
- HUD updates to EnvPanel and status banner (Main HUD label tint + toasts).
- Audio asset hooks or placeholders.
- Telemetry + StatBus notes (`power_warning_level`, StatsProbe columns).
- Documentation in `docs/modules/power.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Power deficits change tint and iconography within one tick and reset gracefully.
2. Audio cue plays once per warning episode and is suppressed when Reduce Motion or silent mode is enabled.
3. Telemetry logs include warning count, duration, and lowest ratio.
4. QA replay confirms warnings trigger as expected and remain within comfort guidelines.
