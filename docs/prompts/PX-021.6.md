# PX-021.6 - Environment Tier Data Authoring
**Targets:** RM-021  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Author milestone profiles for each environment tier, wire tier swaps into EnvironmentService, and document designer levers for future balancing.

## Objectives
1. Expand `data/environment_profiles.tsv` with tiered presets for Backyard through Synthetic Lab eras.
2. Implement tier swap logic keyed off prestige milestones and layout unlocks.
3. Surface designer notes and quick tuning guide in docs.
4. Add telemetry labels so replays indicate which tier was active.

## Dependencies
- Diorama evolution work (PX-021.4) to reflect tiers visually.
- Prestige milestones (PX-015.1) to expose tier unlock triggers.

## Deliverables
- Updated TSV with validation tests.
- EnvironmentService patch handling tier transitions.
- Documentation in `docs/architecture/Implementation_TODO.md` and `docs/design/Environment_Playbook.md`.
- Telemetry updates listing active environment tier.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Promoting to a new tier swaps environment presets without restarting the simulation.
2. EnvPanel displays the current tier and provides a tooltip summary.
3. Telemetry runs log tier names, durations, and comfort deltas.
4. Designers can tweak tier data and hot reload the changes.
