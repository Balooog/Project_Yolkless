# PX-017.3 - LiveOps Monitoring and Risk Cadence
**Targets:** RM-017, QA  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Establish the monitoring runbook, update the risk register cadence, and integrate dashboard checks into release gates.

## Objectives
1. Define weekly monitoring tasks (dashboard review, telemetry anomaly scan, log rotation).
2. Update `docs/qa/Risk_Register.md` with cadence notes and escalation flow.
3. Automate reminders or scripts that gather the latest telemetry snapshots.
4. Document how to evaluate LiveOps readiness before each release.

## Dependencies
- Telemetry diff dashboards (PX-014.4).
- Event system metrics (PX-016.2).

## Deliverables
- Monitoring runbook section in `docs/ops/Release_Playbook.md`.
- Risk register updates with cadence table.
- Optional helper script to pull latest dashboards.
- Notes for release milestone checklist.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monitoring runbook outlines responsibilities and timelines with clear owners.
2. Risk register includes cadence rows and links to latest dashboard evidence.
3. Release milestone checklist references monitoring tasks explicitly.
4. LiveOps readiness review can be executed using the documented steps alone.
