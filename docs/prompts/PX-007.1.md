# PX-007.1 - Offline Passive Production
**Targets:** RM-007  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Implement deterministic offline catch-up so returning players receive the correct resources without manual intervention. Add a summary popup that reports earnings, comfort changes, and automation state.

## Objectives
1. Persist the last save timestamp and any pending comfort or automation modifiers.
2. Simulate passive production at the reduced rate defined in `docs/ROADMAP.md` (target 25 percent base, automation adds a multiplier).
3. Clamp the effective offline window to eight hours and store any overflow for telemetry review.
4. Present a reusable offline summary panel that surfaces credits earned, comfort shift, and outstanding modifiers.

## Dependencies
- Save system version 1 with migration guards.
- Economy loop release hooks for shipments and credits.
- UI sheets defined in RM-010 for presenting summary data.

## Deliverables
- `src/economy/OfflineService.gd` (or equivalent) with deterministic simulation.
- Summary scene wired into the HUD flow.
- Save schema update with migration tests.
- Documentation update in `docs/roadmap/RM/RM-007.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Quitting for eight hours and relaunching applies the correct credits, research, and comfort deltas.
2. Summary UI appears once per session and can be dismissed without blocking other panels.
3. Telemetry logs the offline session length and payout.
4. Balance reload preserves offline settings without requiring a restart.
