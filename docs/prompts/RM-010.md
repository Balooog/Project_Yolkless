# RM-010 — Environment Simulation & Director _(Superseded by RM-021)_
**Status:** Archived  
**Summary:** Introduce a reactive environment system so pollution, stress, and reputation visibly evolve alongside production, giving players immediate feedback on factory impact.  
**Legacy Acceptance (for context only):**
- EnvironmentDirector surfaced pollution, stress, and reputation metrics on a cadence.
- Pollution overlay exposed the three bars with localized strings and tooltips.
- Backyard stage visuals responded to director signals (sky tint, coop colors, haze, chicken motion, reputation icon).
- Documentation outlined extensibility for future tiers.

> **Note:** This historical plan has been fully replaced by [RM-021 — Environmental Simulation Layer](../roadmap/RM-021.md) driven by [PX-021.1](PX-021.1.md). Do not author new work against this file; reference RM-021 for active requirements.
