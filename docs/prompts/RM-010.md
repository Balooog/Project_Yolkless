# RM-010 â€” Environment Simulation & Director
**Status:** In Progress  
**Summary:** Introduce a reactive environment system so pollution, stress, and reputation visibly evolve alongside production, giving players immediate feedback on factory impact.  
**Acceptance:**
- EnvironmentDirector surfaces pollution, stress, and reputation metrics and updates them on a cadence.
- Pollution overlay exposes the three bars with localized strings and tooltips.
- Backyard stage visuals respond to director signals (sky tint, coop colors, haze, chicken motion, reputation icon).
- Documentation points to the feature and outlines how to extend to future tiers.
**Related PX:** PX-010.1, PX-010.2  
**PRs:** (pending)

## Scope
- Add `EnvironmentDirector.gd` to aggregate environment state and broadcast updates.
- Build `PollutionOverlay` UI module for live pollution/stress/reputation readouts.
- Create `EnvironmentStage_Backyard` scene that animates visuals based on director values.
- Hook main scene startup into the director and overlay and capture the work in docs/roadmap.

## Notes / Rationale
- Early visual feedback keeps the first minutes lively and sets the stage for later tiers.
- A dedicated director module makes future tiers (Regional Farm, Factory, etc.) plug-and-play.
- Overlay bars echo idle-game expectations while remaining accessible (WCAG palette alignment).
