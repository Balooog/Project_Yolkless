# PX-015.1 — Wisdom Prestige System
**Targets:** RM-015  
**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Outcome:** Planned

## Driver Prompt
# Project Yolkless – PX-015.1  
### Wisdom Prestige System (Targets RM-015)

---

## 1. Scope
Design the prestige loop framed as “wisdom.” Players sell the current farm, retain wisdom currency, and restart runs with experience-based speed multipliers instead of raw output boosts.

## 2. Functional Objectives
1. **Prestige Currency**
   - Track `wisdom_total`, `experience_modifier`, `runs_completed`.
   - Compute multiplier effects that shorten run duration.
2. **Reset Flow**
   - Confirm reset with thematic messaging.
   - Clear run-specific progress while preserving meta unlocks.
3. **Progression Targets**
   - Returns to prior power within 10–15 minutes.
   - Doubling output achievable in ~25–30 minutes post-reset.
4. **Space Colony Unlock**
   - Late-game prestige reward unlocking alternate farm setting.
5. **Narrative Integration**
   - Dialogue, tooltips, and UI framing reinforcing calm mastery theme.

## 3. Architecture Notes
- Extend save schema in `Save.gd` to include wisdom fields with backward-compatible migration.
- Introduce `PrestigeService.gd` handling reset logic and modifier calculations.
- Update economy formulas to factor `experience_modifier` into production speed.
- Provide UI for prestige readiness in main HUD (RM-010).
- Log prestige events for telemetry (RM-014).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
1. Prestige resets wipe appropriate state (upgrades, currency) while retaining meta unlocks.
2. Wisdom multiplier adjusts production speed without duplicating rewards.
3. Save/load across versions maintains wisdom data.
4. UI communicates readiness, earned wisdom, and upcoming benefits.
5. Space Colony content gated behind defined wisdom threshold.

## 5. Deliverables
- `/src/services/PrestigeService.gd`
- UI updates in `ui/widgets/PrestigePanel.tscn` (migrating legacy scenes out of `game/` as needed).
- Narrative copy in `data/strings_prestige.tsv` (migrate from `game/data/strings_prestige.tsv`).
- Unit/integration tests validating reset and save behavior.
- Documentation updates in `/docs/roadmap/RM-015.md`.

## 6. Future Extensions
- Prestige challenges (optional handicaps for bonus wisdom).
- Community leaderboard for wisdom runs.
- Cosmetic unlocks tied to wisdom milestones.
