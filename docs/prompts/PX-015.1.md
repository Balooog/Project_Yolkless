# PX-015.1 - Prestige Theming and Wisdom HUD
**Targets:** RM-015  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Add narrative, visual, and audio cues to the prestige reset along with HUD surfaces that communicate wisdom multipliers during runs.

## Objectives
1. Design and implement the prestige ceremony sequence with reusable assets.
2. Update HUD widgets to show current wisdom, next milestone, and active multipliers.
3. Sync prestige state with EnvironmentService to unlock new tiers.
4. Document prestige pacing targets and telemetry checkpoints.

## Dependencies
- Environment tier data (PX-021.6).
- Art and audio pipeline updates (PX-020.1).
- Localization workflow (PX-022.1) for new copy.

## Deliverables
- Prestige ceremony scene and scripts.
- HUD updates for wisdom tracking.
- Telemetry metrics for wisdom gain and run parity time.
- Documentation in `docs/roadmap/RM/RM-015.md` and `docs/design/Balance_Playbook.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Triggering prestige plays ceremony assets, resets run state, and applies wisdom multipliers.
2. HUD displays current wisdom and next milestone in both desktop and mobile layouts.
3. Telemetry reports prestige events with run duration and post-reset parity checkpoints.
4. Balance playbook captures new pacing assumptions and is reviewed with latest data.
