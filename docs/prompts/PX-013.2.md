# PX-013.2 - Automation HUD and Scheduling Preview
**Targets:** RM-013  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Expose automation schedules, queues, and manual overrides through the HUD so players understand what Auto Feeders and other systems will do next.

## Objectives
1. Extend AutomationService to emit upcoming actions and queue depth.
2. Build HUD widgets (tab sheet and tooltip badges) that show automation modes, timers, and power-limited states.
3. Add controller and keyboard bindings for toggling automation states.
4. Stream automation metrics to telemetry for nightly dashboards.

## Dependencies
- PX-011.3 integration so economy numbers match automation output.
- HUD architecture defined in RM-010.
- Power warnings work (PX-018.3) to inform automation throttling.

## Deliverables
- Automation HUD scene and script updates.
- Controller focus map adjustments and hotkey wiring.
- Telemetry additions for automation modes and queue depth.
- Documentation updates in `docs/modules/automation.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automation sheet displays per-building state, next action timer, and queue usage.
2. Players can toggle automation globally or per building via mouse, controller, or keyboard.
3. Power deficits flag automation entries and show the planned downgrade.
4. Telemetry output includes automation cadence and matches in-game display.
