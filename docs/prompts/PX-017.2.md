# PX-017.2 - Build Export and Smoke Suite
**Targets:** RM-017  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Automate Linux and Windows exports, attach smoke tests, and archive artifacts with hashes for release readiness.

## Objectives
1. Configure Godot export presets and wrap them with CLI tooling.
2. Run post-export smoke tests (launch, menu navigation, sandbox toggle).
3. Store build artifacts under `releases/` with hash manifest.
4. Integrate export step into release checklist and CI.

## Dependencies
- Telemetry automation (PX-014.3) to confirm builds meet performance targets.
- Release automation (PX-018.2) for tagging and changelog updates.

## Deliverables
- Export scripts under `tools/`.
- Smoke test script or manual checklist archived in `docs/qa/`.
- Artifact storage plan and hashing script.
- Documentation updates in `docs/ops/Release_Playbook.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Running the export tool produces Linux and Windows builds without manual changes.
2. Smoke tests pass on both builds (WSL and Windows capture station).
3. Hash manifest stored alongside builds and referenced in release notes.
4. CI or a manual run logs export duration and pass/fail status.
