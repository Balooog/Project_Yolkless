# PX-011.3 - Conveyor to Economy Integration
**Targets:** RM-009, RM-011  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Bind conveyor throughput metrics into the Economy and StatBus layers so visual flow matches shipments, queues signal upcoming jams, and telemetry captures the linkage.

## Objectives
1. Consume `ConveyorManager` spawn and delivery signals inside Economy to convert items-per-second into shipment events.
2. Publish conveyor queue depth and jam alerts to StatBus for HUD and telemetry.
3. Update the Ship Now logic to account for conveyor state so manual shipments remain truthful.
4. Verify that replay captures report matching conveyor and economy numbers.

## Dependencies
- PX-007.1 complete to stabilize offline flows.
- Existing conveyor module under `src/modules/conveyor/`.
- StatBus catalog entries for throughput metrics.

## Deliverables
- Economy integration patch with typed signals.
- StatBus schema update documenting new keys.
- Telemetry regression covering conveyor delivery parity.
- Notes in `docs/modules/conveyor.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Conveyor deliveries increment shipments within one tick in both live play and replays.
2. StatBus exposes queue depth and jam alerts without violating additive rules.
3. HUD displays conveyor warnings when queues exceed threshold and clears them when flow resumes.
4. Replay diff shows matching conveyor and shipment totals with variance below 0.5 percent.
