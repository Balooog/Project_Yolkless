# PX-016.2 - Event and Risk Loop Implementation
**Targets:** RM-016  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Create the weighted event scheduler that introduces calm production perturbations and logs them for telemetry and risk tracking.

## Objectives
1. Build an event table with weighted random selection, cooldowns, and blocking rules.
2. Implement event payloads for feed surplus, belt jam, and solar flare scenarios.
3. Provide HUD and audio feedback that respects accessibility settings.
4. Emit telemetry entries and update the risk register when new events land.

## Dependencies
- Layout and power integration (PX-019.1, PX-018.3).
- Automation telemetry (PX-013.2).

## Deliverables
- EventDirector scripts with scheduling logic.
- HUD overlays and notifications.
- Telemetry schema additions for event start, end, and impact.
- Risk register updates documenting mitigation triggers.

### Implementation Snapshot (Nov 2025 MVP)
- `game/scripts/Main.gd` now runs a lightweight **micro-event loop** that rotates through `overcast_day` and `bulk_order`.  Only one card is active at a time; timers/cooldowns gate the scheduler so events remain calm and predictable.
- Runtime HUD renders a dismissible card (`MicroEventCard`) with localized title/body copy plus a countdown + button, matching PX-016 tone guidance.
- StatBus gained `micro_event_id` and StatsProbe CSV/JSON log the `event_id` column so DocOps can verify replays without screen captures.
- Events currently focus on environmental storytelling and telemetry plumbing; extend the table (PX-016.3) before adding heavier systemic modifiers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Events trigger within configured cadence and never overlap when marked exclusive.
2. HUD shows clear but calm messaging for each event and clears after expiration.
3. Telemetry logs include event type, duration, and production delta.
4. CI replay can inject events deterministically for regression testing.
