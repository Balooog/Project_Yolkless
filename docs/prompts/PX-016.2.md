# PX-016.2 - Event and Risk Loop Implementation
**Targets:** RM-016  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Create the weighted event scheduler that introduces calm production perturbations and logs them for telemetry and risk tracking.

## Objectives
1. Build an event table with weighted random selection, cooldowns, and blocking rules.
2. Implement event payloads for feed surplus, belt jam, and solar flare scenarios.
3. Provide HUD and audio feedback that respects accessibility settings.
4. Emit telemetry entries and update the risk register when new events land.

## Dependencies
- Layout and power integration (PX-019.1, PX-018.3).
- Automation telemetry (PX-013.2).

## Deliverables
- EventDirector scripts with scheduling logic.
- HUD overlays and notifications.
- Telemetry schema additions for event start, end, and impact.
- Risk register updates documenting mitigation triggers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Events trigger within configured cadence and never overlap when marked exclusive.
2. HUD shows clear but calm messaging for each event and clears after expiration.
3. Telemetry logs include event type, duration, and production delta.
4. CI replay can inject events deterministically for regression testing.
