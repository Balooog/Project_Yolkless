# PX-010.1 — UI & Control Architecture
**Targets:** RM-010  
**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Outcome:** Landed *(prototype HUD integrated — see RM-010 status)*

## Driver Prompt
# Project Yolkless – PX-010.1  
### UI & Control Architecture (Targets RM-010)

---

## 1. Scope
Design the mobile-first control framework with a persistent top HUD, interactive factory canvas, and bottom tab bar. Ensure the layout scales to desktop and accommodates feed-first tactile interaction.

## 2. Functional Objectives
1. **Top Banner HUD**
   - Displays credits, storage, PPS, research points, and alerts.
   - Remains visible across modal panels.
2. **Factory Canvas**
   - Zoomable section for placement, automation overlays, and events.
   - Supports gesture input (pinch, pan) and keyboard navigation.
3. **Bottom Tab Bar**
   - Tabs: Home, Store, Research, Automation, Prestige.
   - Feed button anchored bottom-center with multitap shortcut to shop.
4. **Sheet Panels**
   - Each tab opens as a sheet overlay without hiding the top banner.
   - Non-blocking; background interactions pause only when required.
5. **Desktop Parity**
   - Map tab bar to side dock with hotkeys.
   - Maintain focus order and controller support.

## 3. Architecture Notes
- Adopt responsive layout constants for breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Define reusable Godot UI scenes for banners, tabs, and sheets.
- Integrate accessibility guidelines (contrast, minimum touch targets, focus cues).
- Plan hook points for telemetry widgets (RM-014) and automation toggles (RM-013).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
1. Wireframe set covering portrait mobile and desktop layouts.
2. Prototype scenes demonstrating banner, canvas, and tab transitions.
3. Input map handling touch, keyboard, and controller navigation.
4. Accessibility checklist (WCAG contrast, font scaling, focus management).
5. Documentation outlining layout tokens and extension strategy.

## 5. Deliverables
- `/docs/roadmap/RM-010.md` updated with decisions.
- UI wireframes in `/docs/ui/` (Figma export or annotated images).
- Prototype scene `scenes/prototype/ui_architecture.tscn`.
- Input configuration updates in `project.godot`.
- QA checklist for UI regressions.

## 6. Future Extensions
- Dynamic tutorial overlays and gesture hints.
- Configurable panels for mod/community layouts.
- Split-screen or windowed desktop variants.
