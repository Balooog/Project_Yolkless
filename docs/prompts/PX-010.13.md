# PX-010.13 - Accessibility and Controller Final Pass
**Targets:** RM-010  
**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Solo Dev

## Scope
Complete the outstanding accessibility and controller support items for the HUD, including focus order, color contrast, and motion reduction.

## Objectives
1. Audit HUD components for focus order and controller parity; fix any gaps.
2. Validate color contrast against token definitions and provide alternative palettes.
3. Ensure Reduce Motion disables non-essential animations across sandbox and conveyor layers.
4. Update the accessibility checklist with test evidence.

## Dependencies
- Automation HUD updates (PX-013.2).
- Art and audio pipeline updates (PX-020.1).

## Deliverables
- HUD and controller mapping fixes.
- Contrast adjustments and supporting palette tokens.
- Test notes appended to `docs/qa/RM-010-ui-checklist.md`.
- Accessibility section refresh in `docs/ux/UI_Principles.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Controller navigation can reach every actionable HUD element with predictable focus order.
2. All HUD text and icons meet documented contrast ratios in both standard and reduced motion palettes.
3. Reduce Motion mode dampens sandbox and conveyor visuals without affecting simulation cadence.
4. Accessibility checklist updated with dated sign-off.
