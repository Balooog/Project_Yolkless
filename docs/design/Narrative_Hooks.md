## Usage Tips

- Add references in PX briefs when designing new nodes.
- Keep lines short enough for HUD tooltips (<70 characters) when possible.
- Pair with upgrade families in `/docs/design/Upgrade_Families.md`.
- Reference [UI Principles](../ux/UI_Principles.md) for placement/overflow expectations.
