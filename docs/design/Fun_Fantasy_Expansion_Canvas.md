# Fun & Fantasy Expansion Canvas

> Captures the emotional design goals introduced in the Fun & Fantasy sweep. Use this as the narrative spine for roadmap updates.

## Objectives
1. Make core idle loops emotionally satisfying across moment-to-moment, mid-run, meta-run phases.
2. Introduce layered, Egg Inc–style upgrade families with compounding rewards.
3. Differentiate Shop, Research, and Wisdom systems so each has a unique fantasy and cadence.
4. Ensure every RM/PX documents why a system feels rewarding, not only how it works.

## Artifact Checklist

## Emotional Loop Summary

- **Shipment Burst:** Crates escalate from Basic to Stellar, backed by `Ship Now` micro-choices.
- **Research Delight:** Synergy nodes tie Feed, Power, Comfort into evolving diorama cues.
- **Wisdom Renewal:** Prestige runs shorten while unlocking new ambience and visual tiers.

## Usage

- Reference this canvas when editing roadmap documents—each RM now includes **Player Fantasy**, **Micro-Choices**, and **Fun Curve** sections.
- When adding new upgrades or research nodes, first slot them into an Upgrade Family and add flavor lines to `Narrative_Hooks.md`.
- QA should pull scenarios from `/docs/quality/Playtest_Scenarios.md` to validate feelings match telemetry.
