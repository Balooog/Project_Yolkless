# Product Pillars

## Cozy Mastery Loop
- Keep the Comfort Index front-and-center so players always understand how their farm is performing across idle windows.
- Surface short-term levers (Burst feeding, Ship Now) alongside evergreen upgrades to reinforce the sense of daily progress.

## Transparent Systems
- Maintain TSV-driven balance with live hot-reload (`R`) so designers and agents can tune without editor friction.
- Pair every major mechanic with an in-game tooltip or glossary entry; avoid opaque multipliers or hidden cooldowns.

## Sustainable LiveOps
- Build telemetry hooks through StatBus and nightly replays (`reports/nightly/`) so LiveOps can react quickly to comfort drops.
- Keep the roadmap cadence visible in docs/roadmap and AGENTS, ensuring each RM/PX thread traces back to a product objective.

## Accessible Automation
- Respect the modular split (`src/`, `ui/`, `data/`) and document service APIs so contributors can extend automation without touching legacy `game/` code.
- Ship UI changes through reusable atoms (`ui/components`) and narrative guides (`docs/design/Narrative_Hooks.md`) to preserve tone and legibility.
