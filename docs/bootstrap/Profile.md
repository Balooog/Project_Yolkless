# DocOps Profile Selection

- **Primary profile:** Game/Simulation
  - **Rationale:** Godot 4.5 project with simulation tick guardrails, StatBus telemetry, replay tooling, and LiveOps dashboards aligns with the Game/Sim module inventory described in `docops_profiles.yaml`.
  - **Key emphases for this repo:** Maintain 10 Hz simulation spine, document StatBus keys, capture telemetry replay workflows, and preserve UI/comfort tone guidance.
- **Adapters applied:** _None_ — no geophysics, mobile, or timesheet cues detected during discovery.

See `docs/bootstrap/Adapters_Applied.md` for an auditable record of adapter decisions and `docs/bootstrap/Clarifications.md` for open questions.
