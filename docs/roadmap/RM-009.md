# RM-009 â€” Conveyor Belt Visual Module

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-009.1](../prompts/PX-009.1.md)
- **Status:** Active
- **Owner:** Systems & Visual Engineering
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-009-conveyor-belt`

## Overview
Deliver a hybrid visual/simulation conveyor system that keeps production readable and performant. Animated items move along spline-based belts, queue under load, and report throughput metrics to the economy loop. Target 500 concurrent tokens at 60 FPS.

## Key Objectives
- Chainable spline segments with pooled logic and smooth interpolation.
- Visual queue/jam states aligned with logical capacity.
- Live metrics (`items_sec`, `queue_len`, `efficiency`) exposed to HUD/telemetry.
- Belt skins that react to upgrades without dropping below the frame budget.

## Recent Progress
- Core conveyor module implemented under `src/modules/conveyor/` with belt, item, and manager scripts.
- `ConveyorBelt.gd` supports multi-segment paths, queuing logic, and scrolling visuals tied to speed.
- `ConveyorManager.gd` emits spawn/delivery signals, tracks throughput, and logs rate/queue snapshots.
- Demo scene `scenes/demo_conveyor.tscn` showcases spawning, queuing, and HUD stats for designers.
- Main scene now instantiates `FactoryConveyor.tscn`, rendering belts above the farm and spawning items at live PPS for readability.

## Next Steps
- Connect deliveries to Economy production hooks (RM-011) to validate balance pacing against real belt flow.
- Explore upgrade-driven belt skins and speed modifiers once RM-015 prestige themes are in place.

## Dependencies
- Upstream economy pacing: [RM-011](RM-011.md)
- UI overlays for metrics: [RM-010](RM-010.md)
- Future automation tie-ins: [RM-013](RM-013.md)

## Acceptance Outline
See PX-009.1 for full criteria. Core expectations:
1. Belts animate smoothly with paused/resumed easing.
2. Tokens queue when downstream capacity is exhausted.
3. Metrics stream to telemetry and debug overlays.
4. Demo scene proves 500-token scenario within perf limits.
