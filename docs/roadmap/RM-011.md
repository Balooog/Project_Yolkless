# RM-011 — Early Economy Loop

- **PX Anchors:** [PX-011.1](../prompts/PX-011.1.md), [PX-011.2](../prompts/PX-011.2.md)
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner:** Economy Design
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-011-early-economy`

## Overview
Tune the first five minutes of play: capped storage, auto-dump safety valves, and delayed upgrade access. The loop should educate the player, deliver the first upgrade around the two-to-three minute mark, and surface telemetry for balancing.
Align pacing and reward cadence with the [Idle Game Comparative Analysis](../analysis/IdleGameComparative.md) comfort-idle guidance.

## Player Fantasy
- Watch crates stack up while deciding whether to ship immediately or wait for a bigger payout; the shipment whoosh is a micro-celebration.
- Early feed upgrades lengthen bursts so players feel hands-on mastery before automation arrives.
- Storage upgrades transform crates from “basic” to “contract” quality, unlocking new customers and narrative hooks.

## Micro-Choices
- Tap **Ship Now** for an instant but smaller reward, or hold out for an auto-dump that delivers grade bonuses.
- Invest first credits into Feed Optimization for longer manual bursts, or into Shipment Tech for bigger crates—both should feel viable.
- Choose when to toggle burst cadence versus relaxing idle watching; telemetry should capture these branches.

## Fun Curve
- Minute 0–2: curiosity—fill the first crate and experience the satisfying launch animation.
- Minute 2–5: agency—unlock the first feed upgrade and experiment with Ship Now versus auto-dump rhythms.
- Minute 5+: anticipation—Contract Crates introduce tiered payouts and foreshadow research unlocks.

## Key Objectives
- Balance `balance.tsv` constants for 3–5 minute progression pacing.
- Provide a manual **Ship Now** control with tuned payout scaling.
- Ensure the first Feed Optimization upgrade is affordable within 5 minutes of active play.
- Implement auto-dump behavior once storage saturates.
- Gate upgrades until milestones are met; log shop state via ShopDebug.
- Keep first upgrade pricing (prod_1 at 50 credits) reachable off the inaugural shipment so players earn an immediate win.
- Provide tooling to capture economy snapshots for telemetry (feeding RM-014).

## Dependencies
- UI display of economy values: [RM-010](RM-010.md).
- Upgrade unlock logic: [RM-012](RM-012.md).
- Telemetry harness: [RM-014](RM-014.md).

## Acceptance Outline
See PX-011.1 / PX-011.2. Success when:
1. `balance.tsv` changes are hot-reload friendly and versioned.
2. Simulations confirm first upgrade timing target.
3. ShopDebug outputs actionable missing-requirement reasons.
4. Storage, dump, and offline gains behave per design.
