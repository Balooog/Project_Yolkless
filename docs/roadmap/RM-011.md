# RM-011 — Early Economy Loop

- **PX Anchors:** [PX-011.1](../prompts/PX-011.1.md), [PX-011.2](../prompts/PX-011.2.md)
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner:** Economy Design
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-011-early-economy`

## Overview
Tune the first five minutes of play: capped storage, auto-dump safety valves, and delayed upgrade access. The loop should educate the player, deliver the first upgrade around the two-to-three minute mark, and surface telemetry for balancing.
Align pacing and reward cadence with the [Idle Game Comparative Analysis](../analysis/IdleGameComparative.md) comfort-idle guidance.

## Key Objectives
- Balance `balance.tsv` constants for 3–5 minute progression pacing.
- Implement auto-dump behavior once storage saturates.
- Gate upgrades until milestones are met; log shop state via ShopDebug.
- Keep first upgrade pricing (prod_1 at 50 credits) reachable off the inaugural shipment so players earn an immediate win.
- Provide tooling to capture economy snapshots for telemetry (feeding RM-014).

## Dependencies
- UI display of economy values: [RM-010](RM-010.md).
- Upgrade unlock logic: [RM-012](RM-012.md).
- Telemetry harness: [RM-014](RM-014.md).

## Acceptance Outline
See PX-011.1 / PX-011.2. Success when:
1. `balance.tsv` changes are hot-reload friendly and versioned.
2. Simulations confirm first upgrade timing target.
3. ShopDebug outputs actionable missing-requirement reasons.
4. Storage, dump, and offline gains behave per design.
