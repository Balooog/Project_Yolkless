# RM-019 â€” Factory Layout System

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-019.1](../prompts/PX-019.1.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** Systems & Level Design
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-019-factory-layout`

## Overview
Deliver a grid-based placement system for key factory structures (Coops, Conveyors, Auto-Feeders, Power Plants, Research Nodes). Buildings earn adjacency bonuses and consume power/resources tracked by other modules.

## Key Objectives
- Establish tile grid data structures and placement rules.
- Compute adjacency bonuses and integrate with economy modifiers.
- Sync with automation tick, conveyors, and power budgets.
- Provide editing tools/UX for placement and relocation.

## Dependencies
- Automation orchestrations from [RM-013](RM-013.md).
- Power consumption from [RM-018](RM-018.md).
- UI layout interactions from [RM-010](RM-010.md).
- Event modifiers from [RM-016](RM-016.md).

## Acceptance Outline
Captured in PX-019.1:
1. Grid placement validates costs, power, and adjacency.
2. Buildings emit signals to automation and economy subsystems.
3. Visual feedback indicates valid/invalid placement and bonuses.
4. Save/load retains layout and adjacency state.
