# RM-015 — Wisdom Prestige System

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-015.1](../prompts/PX-015.1.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** Progression Design
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-015-prestige`

## Overview
Reframe prestige as a “wisdom” reset where the farmer restarts enlightened rather than richer. Each reset speeds future runs instead of inflating output, with thematic beats around calm mastery and cyclical growth.

## Key Objectives
- Define prestige currency (Wisdom) and experience modifiers per run.
- Balance run length targets: 10–15 minutes to regain parity, 25–30 minutes to double throughput.
- Update save schema to track total wisdom, modifiers, and runs completed.
- Unlock late-game Space Colony Farm as a prestige milestone.

## Dependencies
- Requires upgrade ladders and research gating from [RM-012](RM-012.md).
- Integrates with automation scaling (RM-013) and power/resource curves (RM-018).
- UI surfaces via [RM-010](RM-010.md).

## Acceptance Outline
Per PX-015.1:
1. Prestige reset flow preserves meta progression and resets run data.
2. Wisdom multipliers accelerate production rates without inflating rewards.
3. Save/load handles prestige data safely.
4. Narrative/thematic copy supports the anti-capitalist framing.
