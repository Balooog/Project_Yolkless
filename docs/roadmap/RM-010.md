# RM-010 â€” UI & Control Architecture

- **PX Anchors:** [PX-010.1](../prompts/PX-010.1.md), [PX-010.2](../prompts/PX-010.2.md)
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** UX / UI Team
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-010-ui-architecture`

## Overview
Establish a mobile-first interface with persistent HUD, tactile feed controls, and modular panels that translate cleanly to desktop. The layout partitions the screen into a top metrics banner, an interactive factory canvas, and a bottom tab bar.

## Key Objectives
- Keep critical stats (credits, storage, PPS, RP) always visible.
- Anchor feed interaction bottom-center with multitap shortcuts.
- Implement tab-based navigation for Store, Research, Automation, Prestige.
- Ensure overlays are non-blocking and keyboard-accessible on desktop.

## Dependencies
- Metrics sources from [RM-011](RM-011.md) and [RM-012](RM-012.md).
- Automation controls from [RM-013](RM-013.md).
- Prestige UI hooks from [RM-015](RM-015.md).

## Acceptance Outline
Documented in PX-010.1 / PX-010.2. Highlights:
1. Responsive layout spec with component inventory.
2. Interaction flows for feed, shop, research, automation toggles.
3. Accessibility considerations (contrast, focus order, control sizing).
4. Desktop parity plan (dock layouts, shortcuts).
