# Project Yolkless — Roadmap Index

This directory houses Roadmap Modules (RM) and their prompt anchors (PX). Treat this index as the authoritative map from high-level goals to detailed design prompts.

Every module should be framed against the comfort-idle benchmarks captured in [`../analysis/IdleGameComparative.md`](../analysis/IdleGameComparative.md); reference it when authoring or revising specs.
