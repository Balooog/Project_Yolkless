# RM-020 â€” Art / Audio Pipeline

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-020.1](../prompts/PX-020.1.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** Art & Audio
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-020-art-audio`

## Overview
Build the content pipeline for dynamic ambience: layered soundscapes scaling with activity, day/night cycles, asset tiering per upgrade, and prestige-driven palette shifts.
Every asset tier should preserve the comfort-idle atmosphere documented in the [Idle Game Comparative Analysis](../analysis/IdleGameComparative.md), emphasizing warmth and serenity over intensity.

## Key Objectives
- Author asset tier strategy aligned with upgrade milestones.
- Implement audio layering responsive to factory throughput and events.
- Coordinate day/night lighting with power usage signals.
- Define thematic color palettes per prestige tier (dawn, serene tones).
- Maintain calm sound design (no harsh spikes) and smooth visual transitions that reinforce comfort-idle play.

## Dependencies
- Power signals from [RM-018](RM-018.md).
- Event triggers from [RM-016](RM-016.md).
- Prestige milestones from [RM-015](RM-015.md).
- UI integration from [RM-010](RM-010.md).

## Acceptance Outline
Per PX-020.1:
1. Audio manager blends layers smoothly under load changes.
2. Visual palette shifts hook into prestige resets and time-of-day.
3. Asset tiering guidelines documented and linked to upgrade data.
4. Pipeline processes assets reproducibly with tooling notes.
