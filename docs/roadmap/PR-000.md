# PR-000: Documentation & DocOps Foundation

## Overview
Stand up a consistent documentation scaffold for Project Yolkless so contributors and agents can navigate the simulation, LiveOps rituals, and balance workflows without hunting through legacy notes.

## Objectives
- Capture discovery and profile selection under `docs/bootstrap/`.
- Align design/dev/quality docs with the Game/Simulation profile in `docops_profiles.yaml`.
- Provide persona-focused quickstarts and a roadmap index that map directly to RM execution.
- Introduce a docs lint stage to CI to keep the tree healthy.

## Acceptance
- `docs/bootstrap/*.md` populated and versioned (`v0.2.0` canvas).
- `docs/quickstarts/gameplay_loop_quickstart.md` and `telemetry_replay_quickstart.md` referenced from README + AGENTS.
- Roadmap structure migrated under `docs/roadmap/RM/` with updated index + tasks list.
- CI includes docs stage and publishes lint artifacts.
