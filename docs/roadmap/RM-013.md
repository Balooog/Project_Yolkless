# RM-013 — Automation Core

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-013.1](../prompts/PX-013.1.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** Systems Design
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-013-automation`

## Overview
Introduce automation layers (Auto-Feeder, conveyor sync, power-aware toggles) that can operate in OFF / MANUAL / AUTO modes per building, backed by a global automation director.
Balance automation unlock cadence per the [Idle Game Comparative Analysis](../analysis/IdleGameComparative.md) to preserve the comfort-idle flow while rewarding mastery.

## Player Fantasy
- Watch the farm learn your rhythm—machines take over the night shift while you still choose when to Ship Now.
- Visualize calm efficiency: arms glide, conveyors sparkle, and hens relax under smart lighting.
- Automation feels like a trusted partner, not a replacement.

## Micro-Choices
- Decide which stations get auto-control first (feeders, shipment batching, comfort devices).
- Toggle manual override mid-session for tactile moments without losing automated cadence.
- Balance power draw (RM-018) vs automation gains—push the grid or stay conservative.

## Fun Curve
- Unlock: relief—auto-bursts free fingers without stealing agency.
- Mid-tier: mastery—customize schedules, sync with shipment windows.
- Late-tier: serenity—Self-aware Roost keeps production humming as you observe the sandbox.

## Key Objectives
- Define automation state machine and tick cadence tied into the economy update loop.
- Provide manual overrides with global enable/disable controls.
- Integrate with conveyor throughput (RM-009) and power consumption (RM-018).
- Surface visual overlays for automation status and power draw.

## Dependencies
- Requires upgrades/unlocks from [RM-012](RM-012.md).
- Draws power budget from [RM-018](RM-018.md).
- Ties into factory layout placement rules from [RM-019](RM-019.md).

## Interplay Notes
- Automation batches shipments but never disables manual Ship Now; players can “inject” a burst whenever they want.
- Research nodes (RM-012) unlock smarter schedules; wisdom levels reduce retune time after prestige.
- Power warnings from RM-018 should gently encourage upgrading Power Efficiency family before enabling heavy automation.
- Reference `/docs/design/Upgrade_Families.md` when introducing new automation tiers to keep flavor and stats aligned.

## Acceptance Outline
See PX-013.1 for full spec. Milestones:
1. Automation director processes scheduled actions each tick.
2. Buildings expose consistent automation API.
3. Visual indicators reflect mode changes and power impacts.
4. Save data persists automation preferences.
