# RM-013 â€” Automation Core

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-013.1](../prompts/PX-013.1.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** Systems Design
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-013-automation`

## Overview
Introduce automation layers (Auto-Feeder, conveyor sync, power-aware toggles) that can operate in OFF / MANUAL / AUTO modes per building, backed by a global automation director.
Balance automation unlock cadence per the [Idle Game Comparative Analysis](../analysis/IdleGameComparative.md) to preserve the comfort-idle flow while rewarding mastery.

## Key Objectives
- Define automation state machine and tick cadence tied into the economy update loop.
- Provide manual overrides with global enable/disable controls.
- Integrate with conveyor throughput (RM-009) and power consumption (RM-018).
- Surface visual overlays for automation status and power draw.

## Dependencies
- Requires upgrades/unlocks from [RM-012](RM-012.md).
- Draws power budget from [RM-018](RM-018.md).
- Ties into factory layout placement rules from [RM-019](RM-019.md).

## Acceptance Outline
See PX-013.1 for full spec. Milestones:
1. Automation director processes scheduled actions each tick.
2. Buildings expose consistent automation API.
3. Visual indicators reflect mode changes and power impacts.
4. Save data persists automation preferences.
