# RM-012 — Upgrade & Research System

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-016.1](../prompts/PX-016.1.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** Economy & Progression
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-012-upgrades`

## Overview
Unify soft-currency upgrades and research unlocks under a shared schema. Research tiers unlock automation and prestige gateways while persisting state across saves.
Keep upgrade pacing and discovery beats aligned with the [Idle Game Comparative Analysis](../analysis/IdleGameComparative.md) comfort-idle expectations.

## Player Fantasy
- Step into the research lab and pick which blueprint turns your humble coop into a serene smart farm.
- Unlock shipment-grade bonuses that feel like Egg Inc–style fleet upgrades, but wrapped in calm storytelling.
- See the diorama respond—new solar canopies and zen gardens appear as research levels rise.

## Micro-Choices
- Spend early RP on Feed Optimization synergies for longer bursts or on Shipment Tech to amplify crate quality.
- Chase synergy nodes (e.g., Logistics Mesh) when your shipment grade catches up, or bank RP for prestige-ready unlocks.
- Decide when to unlock automation conveniences knowing Wisdom runs will re-acquire them faster.

## Fun Curve
- Tier 0: surprise—first blueprint instantly tweaks burst feel.
- Tier 1: satisfaction—Contract Crates + drone unlocks deliver visible payout jumps.
- Tier 2+: mastery—complex synergies let players sculpt comfort, power, and automation balance.

## Key Objectives
- Design TSV schema with prerequisites, costs, and effects for both upgrades and research.
- Build UI tabs: linear shop list and graph-based research lab.
- Add passive research point (RP) accrual and milestone rewards.
- Persist ownership and unlock state via the save system.

## Dependencies
- Requires balanced economy inputs from [RM-011](RM-011.md).
- Feeds automation gating in [RM-013](RM-013.md).
- Connects prestige reset flow from [RM-015](RM-015.md).

## Interplay Notes
- Shipment grades (from RM-011) grant RP bursts; Contract Crates unlock the Tier 1 lab.
- Automation (RM-013) consumes research unlocks but must respect manual overrides—Ship Now stays available.
- Wisdom multipliers (RM-015) reduce RP costs or speed acquisition so prestige runs re-open the tree quickly.
- Align research nodes with upgrade families via `/docs/design/Upgrade_Families.md` and `/docs/design/Research_Tree.md`.

## Acceptance Outline
Detailed in PX-016.1. Expected deliverables include:
1. Validated TSV schema and parsing pipeline.
2. UI prototypes for shop and research.
3. Signal hooks for unlock notifications and RP gain.
4. Save/load tests covering upgrade and research progress.
