# RM-012 â€” Upgrade & Research System

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-016.1](../prompts/PX-016.1.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** Economy & Progression
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-012-upgrades`

## Overview
Unify soft-currency upgrades and research unlocks under a shared schema. Research tiers unlock automation and prestige gateways while persisting state across saves.
Keep upgrade pacing and discovery beats aligned with the [Idle Game Comparative Analysis](../analysis/IdleGameComparative.md) comfort-idle expectations.

## Key Objectives
- Design TSV schema with prerequisites, costs, and effects for both upgrades and research.
- Build UI tabs: linear shop list and graph-based research lab.
- Add passive research point (RP) accrual and milestone rewards.
- Persist ownership and unlock state via the save system.

## Dependencies
- Requires balanced economy inputs from [RM-011](RM-011.md).
- Feeds automation gating in [RM-013](RM-013.md).
- Connects prestige reset flow from [RM-015](RM-015.md).

## Acceptance Outline
Detailed in PX-016.1. Expected deliverables include:
1. Validated TSV schema and parsing pipeline.
2. UI prototypes for shop and research.
3. Signal hooks for unlock notifications and RP gain.
4. Save/load tests covering upgrade and research progress.
