# RM-018 â€” Power & Resource Layer

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-018.1](../prompts/PX-018.1.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** Systems Engineering
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-018-power`

## Overview
Create an abstract power model balancing production and consumption across buildings. Provide visual cues (ambient lighting, overlays) and prepare for future multi-zone grids.

## Key Objectives
- Define power generation/consumption stats for each structure.
- Track total capacity and expose `powerState` for automation decisions.
- Feed visual tinting and alerts based on power ratio.
- Support future extension to multiple grid zones.

## Dependencies
- Automation control decisions from [RM-013](RM-013.md).
- Factory layout placement costs from [RM-019](RM-019.md).
- Event modifiers from [RM-016](RM-016.md).
- UI readouts from [RM-010](RM-010.md).

## Acceptance Outline
Outlined in PX-018.1:
1. Power ledger updates each tick with building operations.
2. UI/overlay communicates power surplus/deficit clearly.
3. Hooks exposed to automation, events, and telemetry.
4. Documentation covers configuration for new buildings.
