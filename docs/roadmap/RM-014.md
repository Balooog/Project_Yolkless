# RM-014 â€” Telemetry & QA Pipeline

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-017.1](../prompts/PX-017.1.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** QA & Tooling
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-014-telemetry`

## Overview
Build a repeatable telemetry harness that captures production metrics, automates headless simulations, and exports data for analysis. Enables balance regression tests and QA reproducibility.

## Key Objectives
- Expand logging to cover PPS, queue length, credit delta, upgrade timing.
- Implement headless one-hour simulation runner with parameter overrides.
- Export telemetry to CSV/JSON for external analysis.
- Integrate hooks with ShopDebug/Economy instrumentation (RM-011).

## Dependencies
- Economy stats from [RM-011](RM-011.md) and upgrades from [RM-012](RM-012.md).
- Automation events from [RM-013](RM-013.md).
- UI surfaces to display telemetry snapshots from [RM-010](RM-010.md).

## Acceptance Outline
Outlined in PX-017.1:
1. CLI pipeline runs deterministic simulations.
2. Logs emit structured events and summary reports.
3. QA can replay sessions and compare against baselines.
4. Documentation describes usage and integration points.
