# RM-016 — Event & Risk System

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-016.2](../prompts/PX-016.2.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** Systems Design
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-016-events`

## Overview
Introduce periodic events (feed surplus, belt jam, solar flare) that gently perturb production by roughly ±10% for short durations. Events should be telegraphed, visually represented, and adjustable in frequency.

## Key Objectives
- Weighted random scheduler with cooldowns and player feedback.
- Event payloads affecting feed, conveyors, power, or automation.
- Visual popups and ambient changes tied to event type.
- Hooks to telemetry so QA can validate event distribution.

## Dependencies
- Economy metrics from [RM-011](RM-011.md).
- Automation hooks from [RM-013](RM-013.md).
- Power layer effects from [RM-018](RM-018.md).
- UI surfaces from [RM-010](RM-010.md).

## Acceptance Outline
Captured in PX-016.2:
1. Configurable event table with weights and effect scripts.
2. Events broadcast start/end signals and update HUD overlays.
3. Log output tracks event frequency and impact.
4. Player-facing feedback remains informative without overwhelming.
