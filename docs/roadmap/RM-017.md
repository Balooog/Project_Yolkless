# RM-017 â€” Release Phases & Milestones

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-018.2](../prompts/PX-018.2.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Planned
- **Owner:** Production
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-017-release-plan`

## Overview
Define release phases from prototype to public launch, establishing criteria for Alpha, Beta, and final release. Includes automation for tagging builds and aligning roadmap modules with milestone gates.

## Key Objectives
- Document phase definitions (Manual Loop Prototype through Art/Audio polish).
- Map RM dependencies to each milestone.
- Create version-tagging automation guidelines for CI/CD.
- Outline QA checkpoints and telemetry expectations per phase.

## Dependencies
- Draws completion signals from all feature RMs.
- Relies on telemetry readiness from [RM-014](RM-014.md).
- Requires art/audio plans from [RM-020](RM-020.md).

## Acceptance Outline
Planned in PX-018.2:
1. Published release milestone document with entry/exit criteria.
2. Branch/tag strategy encoded in tooling docs.
3. Checklists for QA, localization, and regression per phase.
4. Timeline updated as modules progress, with roadmap cross-links.
