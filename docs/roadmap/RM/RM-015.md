# RM-015 — Wisdom Prestige System

- **PX Anchor:** [PX-015.1](../prompts/PX-015.1.md) _(to be created)_
- **Status:** Active — prestige loop implemented, theming pending
- **Owner:** Progression Design
- **Branch Prefix:** `feature/RM-015-prestige`

## Overview
Reframe prestige as a “wisdom” reset where the farmer restarts enlightened rather than richer. Each reset speeds future runs instead of inflating output, with thematic beats around calm mastery and cyclical growth.
Match tone and pacing targets outlined in the [Idle Game Comparative Analysis](../analysis/IdleGameComparative.md) comfort-idle framework.

## Player Fantasy
- Launch a final Stellar Shipment, watch the farm exhale, and begin anew with deeper insight.
- Each prestige bathes the coop in new light or ambience, signaling that wisdom reshapes the world.
- You feel like a calm mentor returning to familiar tools with fresh clarity.

## Micro-Choices
- Choose the right moment to prestige: after unlocking Hyperloop conduits, or after completing a research tier.
- Spend earned wisdom on multiplier tracks that emphasize feed bursts, shipment yields, or comfort bonuses.
- Decide whether to start the next run aggressively (Ship Now frequently) or lean into automation knowing it reactivates quickly.

## Fun Curve
- Prestige 1: exhilaration—production parity returns around minute 10 with new soundscape cues.
- Prestige 3–5: experimentation—play with alternative upgrade orders thanks to faster RP generation.
- Prestige 10+: awe—Space Colony farm and Dream Synth ambience reward dedication.

## Key Objectives
- Define prestige currency (Wisdom) and experience modifiers per run.
- Balance run length targets: 10–15 minutes to regain parity, 25–30 minutes to double throughput.
- Update save schema to track total wisdom, modifiers, and runs completed.
- Unlock late-game Space Colony Farm as a prestige milestone.

## Recent Progress
- Economy prestige routines (`Economy.gd`) grant wisdom, reset upgrade state, and rebind automation once a run ends.
- UI prototype exposes prestige readiness, earned stars, and reset confirmations; StatBus tracks modifiers for telemetry.
- Save pipeline persists wisdom, research owned, and migration handles legacy payloads.

## Remaining Work
- Theme the prestige experience (audio/visual beats, RM-020 tie-ins) and expose wisdom multipliers in the live HUD.
- Balance turnaround targets using RM-014 telemetry, documenting new KPIs in `docs/design/Balance_Playbook.md`.
- Author Space Colony milestone copy + assets and integrate with Environment presets (RM-021 roadmap).

## Dependencies
- Requires upgrade ladders and research gating from [RM-012](RM-012.md).
- Integrates with automation scaling (RM-013) and power/resource curves (RM-018).
- UI surfaces via [RM-010](RM-010.md).

## Interplay Notes
- Wisdom multipliers apply to base PPS, shipment yield, and research production—see `/docs/design/Wisdom_Multipliers.md`.
- Research Tier 3 nodes require specific wisdom levels; ensure prestige growth unlocks new fantasies instead of raw grind.
- Automation resumes swiftly post-prestige: RM-013 should read multiplier values to seed smarter schedules.
- Upgrade families (especially Comfort Tuning) should gain new tiers at key wisdom milestones; coordinate via `/docs/design/Upgrade_Families.md`.

## Acceptance Outline
Per PX-015.1:
1. Prestige reset flow preserves meta progression and resets run data.
2. Wisdom multipliers accelerate production rates without inflating rewards.
3. Save/load handles prestige data safely.
4. Narrative/thematic copy supports the anti-capitalist framing.
